The basic concept in rstanbdp is to sample a single error term instead of two. The
idea comes from the Weighted Deming procedure proposed by Linnet in multiple
articles, for example [K. Linnet, Clinical Chemistry 44:5, 1024-1031 (1998)](https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/44.5.1024)

Given a set of $$N$$ pairs of $$ X_{i} $$ and $$ Y_{i} $$ in $$ \mathbb{R^{2}} $$ and for a fixed error ratio $$ \lambda = \frac{\sigma^{2}_{X}}{\sigma^{2}_{Y}} $$ the estimated $$ \hat{X}_{i} $$ and $$ \hat{Y}_{i}$$ are calculated as follow, given $$ \alpha$$ the intercept and $$ \beta $$ the slope that are sampled from the priors (see further below for priors).

$$ P_{i} = X_{i} \cdot \beta + \alpha  $$

$$  \delta_{i} = Y_{i} - P_{i}  $$

$$  \hat{X}_{i} = X_{i} + \frac{\lambda \cdot \delta_{i} \cdot \beta}{1 + \lambda \cdot \beta^2} $$

$$  \hat{Y}_{i} = Y_{i} - \frac{\delta_{i}}{1 + \lambda \cdot \beta^2} $$


Then the euclidean distances $$ e_{i} $$ of the estimated points from its real position are calculated with:


$$  e_{i} = \sqrt{(X_{i} - \hat{X}_{i})^{2} + (Y_{i} - \hat{Y}_{i})^{2} }  $$


Thus in the Bayesian model, setting the following priors. Priors parameter are fully tweak able. Worth mentioning that the $$ \beta $$ prior is per default truncated at $$ \beta = 0.3333  $$. This truncation prevents erratic behaviour of the sampling mechanism when $$ \lambda $$ is strongly different from 1.  

$$ \alpha \sim \mathcal{N}( 0 , \sigma^{2}_{\alpha}) $$

$$ \beta \sim \mathcal{N}( 1 , \sigma^{2}_{\beta}) $$

$$ \sigma \sim \mathcal{E}(\lambda_{sigma}) $$



The likelihood gets optimised as

$$ e_{i} \sim \mathcal{T}(0,\sigma,df = N-2)  $$

Of course a normal distribution for the likelihood would also be a good option. Test

For the heteroscedastic linear model the $$ \sigma $$ prior is substituted by a pair of linear parameters $$ \alpha_{var} $$ and $$ \beta_{var}$$ with normal priors

$$ \alpha_{var} \sim \mathcal{N}( 0 , \sigma^{2}_{\alpha_{var}}) $$

$$ \beta_{var} \sim \mathcal{N}( 0 , \sigma^{2}_{\beta_{var}}) $$

and the likelihood function is defined as

$$ e_{i} \sim \mathcal{T}(0,\alpha_{var} + \beta_{var} \cdot \frac{X_{i}+Y_{i}}{2},df = N-2)  $$

Models with additional error structure are planned.
