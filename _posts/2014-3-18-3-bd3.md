title: "Bayesian Deming regression - About the sampling method"
---

The basic concept in rstanbdp is to sample a single error term instead of two. The
idea comes from the Weighted Deming procedure proposed by Linnet in multiple
articles, for example K. Linnet, Clinical Chemistry 44:5, 1024-1031 (1998) <https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/44.5.1024>

Given a set of $$ X $$ and $$ Y $$ in $$ \mathbb{R^{2}} $$ and for a fixed error ratio $$ \lambda = \frac{\sigma^{2}_{X}}{\sigma^{2}_{Y}} $$ the averages $$ \hat{X} $$ and $$ \hat{Y}  $$
get calculated. The intercept $$ \alpha $$ and the slope $$ \beta $$  of the line are given calculated with the following procedure. the the index $$ i $$ for each variable is omitted for simplicity

$$ P = X \cdot \beta + \alpha   $$

$$  \delta = Y - P  $$

$$  \hat{X} = X + \frac{\lambda \cdot \delta \cdot \beta}{1 + \lambda \cdot \beta^2} $$

$$  \hat{Y} = Y - \frac{\delta}{1 + \lambda \cdot \beta^2} $$

Then the euclidian distances $$ e $$ of the estimated points from its real position are calculated with

$$  e = sqrt{(X - \hat{X}^{2} + (Y - \hat{Y})^{2})}  $$

Thus in the Bayesian model, setting the following priors

$$ \alpha \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{alpha}, \sigma_{\alpha^{2}}) $$

$$ \beta \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{beta}, \sigma_{\beta^{2}}) $$

$$ \sigma \sim \mathcal{E}(\labda_{sigma}) $$

And the likelihood gets optimised as

$$ e \sim \mathcal{T}(0,\sigma,df=N-2)  $$

Of course a normal distribution for the likelihood would also be a good option.
