![Three digits one]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/threedigits/threedigits1-1.png)


Here the result of a successful simulation with 400 replicas per point at 3x3 digits precision. Classical PaBa still shows a pretty high asymmetry with r.s.e of over 4%. PBequi is performing better, but shows some bias compared to classical Deming methods with an r.s.e over 2%. Quite surprisingly PBequi with jackknife CI performs better that the analytical version with approx. 1.36% r.s.e.
