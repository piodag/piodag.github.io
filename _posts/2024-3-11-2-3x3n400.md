Here the result of a successful simulation with n=400 at 3x3 digits precision.
Classical PaBa still shows a pretty high asymmetry with r.s.e% of over
4%. PBequi is performing better, but shows some bias compared to
classical Deming methods with an r.s.e% over 2%. Quite surprisingly PBequi
with jackknife CI performs better that the analytical version with
approx. 1.36% r.s.e.

Here below a table of the r.s.e% for the methods

Table of r.s.e.


Below is also reported a plot for the M- and MM-Deming methods. M-Deming
is very well performing, in line with other classical Deming regressions
with a r.s.e% of approx. 1.52%. MM-Deming is confirming itâ€™s bias with a
r.s.e% of 2.28%.

Worth noting that the Deming JE/MD method has am r.s.e% of only 0.62%.
This method seems much more powerful that the traditional ones and also
shows a good symmetry.

There is still an hope for a n=1000 experiment that would provide more
precise values.
