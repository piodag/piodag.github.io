title: Bayesian Deming robustness with a high percentage of outliers

I just uploaded a video showing the differences between typical method
comparison regressions when outliers with leverage are massively present
in the data.

Bayesian Deming methods turn out to be particularly effective already at
df=6 or df=5 for the T-distributed error term setting.

Nonparametric methods are not immune to coefficient shifting due to
outliers and are less robust than expected.
